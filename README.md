# Arduino-Knowledge
During a Solid State Physics experiment, I developed an arduino code that controled the voltage supplied to an LED using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and measured the current flowing through the LED using a current sensor. 

The goal: observe and complete a report on the relationship between the voltage supplied and the current across the LED
